## Research Overview
### Background
Faced with increasingly severe environmental issues that pose significant challenges to human survival, the development and utilization of new energy sources, including renewable energy production and the use of new energy vehicles, have emerged as vital policy tools to address these environmental challenges. This study aims to answer a crucial question: To what extent can the use of clean energy improve environmental quality? 

### Major Datasets
To effectively address our research questions on the impacts of new energy technologies on air quality and infrastructure needs, we leverage a selection of diverse and relevant datasets. These sources provide comprehensive data ranging from air quality metrics, energy production details, and geographical distributions of energy infrastructure to demographic insights：

**Air Quality Index Annual Summary Data (2021):** Provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, uses the proportion of "good days" as a measure of air quality in each U.S. county. 

**Alternative Fueling Station Locations (2021):** Compiled by The Alternative Fuels Data Center, this dataset includes locations of alternative fueling stations across the U.S., reflecting the uptake of new energy vehicles.

**Energy Generation – Form EIA-923 (2021):** This dataset captures detailed monthly and annual data on electricity generation at power plants across the U.S.

**Power Plant – Form EIA-860 (2021):** It contains specific information about generators at electric power plants with significant capacity, including geographic details.

**NCHS Urban-Rural Classification (2013):** This dataset categorizes U.S. counties by urbanization levels, helping contextualize the varying impacts of new energy technologies across different settings.

**DC Public Facilities:** This collection of geospatial data includes locations of public facilities in Washington D.C., such as schools and government buildings.
